# COVID-19-Analysis
Predicting Trends for Potential Virus Outbreaks by Analyzing COVID-19 Data

The primary objective of this project is to leverage data analytics methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing real-time data from the OWiD dataset.

By employing advanced analytical techniques, our aim is to discern patterns, trends, and underlying factors that contributed to the rapid transmission and widespread impact of the virus. This analysis will enable us to identify crucial factors that played a significant role in the pandemic's escalation. We employ various Machine Learning models, ranging from Linear Regression to ARIMA, on a large and extensive data which enabled us to observe various trends in the data as documented in this project.

We developed a dynamic real-time model, which can be continuously researched and analyzed. The insights gleaned from this model will prove instrumental in formulating proactive measures to prevent future outbreaks of such magnitude. By proactively addressing the identified factors, we can collectively work towards averting the devastating effects of similar viral outbreaks in the future, safeguarding public health on a global scale.
